    Read ADMIXTURE files into a `snputils.ancestry.genobj.GlobalAncestryObject`.

    Args:
        Q_file (str or pathlib.Path):
            Path to the file containing the Q matrix (per-sample ancestry proportions).
            It should end with .Q or .txt.
            The file should use space (' ') as the delimiter.
        P_file (str or pathlib.Path):
            Path to the file containing the P/F matrix (per-ancestry SNP frequencies).
            It should end with .P or .txt.
            The file should use space (' ') as the delimiter.
        sample_file (str or pathlib.Path, optional):
            Path to the single-column file containing sample identifiers. 
            It should end with .fam or .txt.
            If None, sample identifiers are not loaded.
        snp_file (str or pathlib.Path, optional):
            Path to the single-column file containing SNP identifiers. 
            It should end with .bim or .txt.
            If None, SNP identifiers are not loaded.
        ancestry_file (str or pathlib.Path, optional):
            Path to the single-column file containing ancestry labels for each sample.
            It should end with .map or .txt.
            If None, ancestries are not loaded.

    Returns:
            **GlobalAncestryObject:** 
                A GlobalAncestryObject instance.
